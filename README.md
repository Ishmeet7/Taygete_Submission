### Problem Statement

The earth is dying. Escape from this planet is the only solution. The Universal space
agency has spotted a wormhole near Saturn. By sending probes through it, you have
discovered that the wormhole opens up possibilities for reaching 5 unknown star systems. Due to limited resources visiting every star system is not possible. You are an Astrophysicist in the team of researchers which has been given the responsibility
to find an exoplanet that can support human life. You have access to the probe data which
contains light curves of all the 5 stars.Tasks are:
1. To find which star systems support exoplanets. 
2. Find the time period of those exoplanets (because humans donâ€™t want longer
years). 
3. Find the distance of those exoplanets from their host stars.
